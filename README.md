## 🚀 Featured Projects

(These are the key projects I've contributed to, which are pinned to my profile.)

### 1. [Game E-commerce Website (Web Application)](https://github.com/LightyWind22/GameStoreWeb)
* **Description:** An e-commerce website allowing admins to upload game links and users to purchase and download them using a credit system.
* **My Role: Frontend Developer** 
    * Developed multiple responsive UI pages (e.g., About, Contact, Footer).
    * Contributed to the front-end development for core e-commerce features, building the complete user interface and client-side logic for the Shopping Cart and Checkout pages.
    * Engineered the client-side state management for the cart, resolving complex synchronization issues between local storage and the user's cart state retrieved from the API.
* **Tech Stack:** Vue, Nodejs, Expressjs, RESTful API, JWT, PostgreSQL.

### 2. [SecureShare: A Client-Side Encrypted File Sharing Platform](https://github.com/LightyWind22/SecureShareWeb)
* **Description:** A secure, full-stack web application designed for sharing sensitive files (.docx, .pdf, .txt). This project's core focus is on client-side security, implementing AES encryption in the browser before files are uploaded. It also features a temporary access system, allowing users to share files via time-limited, expiring URLs. 
* **My Role:**
    * Architected the complete user authentication system from the ground up, including implementing the core Login and Register functionalities.
    * Engineered a secure, token-based session management system using cookies and refresh tokens to handle authentication and keep users logged in.
    * Developed the full authentication lifecycle, adding critical features such as Handle logout and add remember login.
    * Secured the application's routes by connecting the router and implementing authentication middleware (Connect router and add authentication).
    * Built the project's foundation, initializing the application with Handlebars (templating) and pg-promise (PostgreSQL connection), and creating the Login/Register page UI.
    * Managed database deployment (set up to up host database) and handled all version control responsibilities, including routinely merging branches and resolving merge conflicts.
* **Tech Stack:** Nodejs, Expressjs, Handlebars, JWT, PostgreSQL, AES Encryption.

### 3. [802.1X Protocol Simulation (C++)](https://github.com/LightyWind22/802.1X-Protocol-Simulation)
* **Description:** An academic project simulating the EAPOL (EAP over LAN) authentication flow of the 802.1X protocol using C++.
* **My Role:**
    * Architected and implemented the core C++ simulation, building the client-server socket communication framework from the ground up (Supplicant and Authenticator).
    * Implemented two distinct EAP authentication methods:
      * **EAP-MSCHAPv2:** Developed the challenge-response authentication mechanism.
      * **EAP-TTLS:** Integrated the OpenSSL library to establish a secure TLS tunnel for tunneled authentication, including managing and loading server certificates.
    * Enhanced protocol security by implementing SHA-256 for hashing stored user passwords, replacing basic plaintext authentication.
    * Designed a flexible user management system by using a JSON file as a user database and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions for user credentials.
* **Tech Stack:** C++, OpenSSL, SHA-256, JSON, Makefile.
  
### 4. [Library Management Mobile App](https://github.com/LightyWind22/Library-Management-App)
* **Description:** A mobile application for students to search, reserve, and manage their library book loans.
* **My Role: Frontend Developer**
    * Contributed to the core application by implementing the UI for the user authentication flow (Welcome, Login, and Register pages).
    * Developed key features for the Reader role, including the navigation logic from the Home screen to the Book Detail page (fetching data by ID).
    * Implemented specific UI/UX features for multiple user roles, including:
      * **Librarian:** Built the home dashboard and user controls.
      * **Storekeeper:** Created the "Add Book" interface.
      * **Reader:** Implemented client-side validation checks (e.g., "borrow book conditions").
    * Client-side validation checks (e.g., "borrow book conditions") for the Reader.
    * Enhanced user feedback by integrating Toast notifications and Error Dialogs for API responses and validation.
* **Tech Stack:** Java/Kotlin, Firebase.
